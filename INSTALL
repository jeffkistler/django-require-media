Installing Require Media
========================

To install Require Media, run the following command inside this directory::

    python setup.py install

Require Media requires Python 2.5 or newer and Django 1.2 or newer.
It is possible that it will work without incident on Python 2.4 and/or with an
earlier version of Django, but these configurations have not been tested.
